# Citydo, the site to save your travel times

This here is the MVP of Citydo that was meant to be used at production.

The main parts of the site are the arrival and travel time module;
The rest are shown here mostly for demonstrational porpuses.

Any feedback is welcome as long as you remember this isn't the actual website here.
