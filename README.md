# Citydo, the site to save your travel times

This here is mostly the draft ideas that were meant to be implemented but were deemed unnecessary or cut-out for lack of time.

The main parts of the site namely the arrival and travel time module and the in use model are left out for security reasons; 
The rest are shown here mostly for demonstrational porpuses.

Any feedback is welcome as long as you remember this isn't the actual website here.
